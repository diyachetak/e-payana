e-payana is our dream from a long time. We dedicate it to our little son Rio. We wish to share our memorable experiences that we have gathered through this journey. 

### More Information

We ventured out of India 10 years ago. India is at our heart which guides us who we are and extends the values like love, culture and relationship acting as a launchpad for experiencing things around the world. 

In our native language 'e' stands for 'this'. Hence we thought of calling our site 'e-payana' where 'payana' stands for 'the journey'. We have had an interesting journey so far and looking forward to more new rejuvinating experiences.

### What

Starting with the birth story of our son, we wish to share some of the valuable inputs for a healthy natural birth, some of the nutritious vegan and vegetarian reciped for living a healthy life and our travel experiences. Hope you all enjoy reading and trying some of the recipes.
