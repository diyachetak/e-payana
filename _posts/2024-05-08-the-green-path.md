It was one of those hot sunny days in December. I was eager to meet my friends. It had been a long time since we met. We planned to meet at “The Green Path” organic restaurant. It’s a very special place. That day, there was a community singing event. Me, my husband and my 14 months old son planned to take part in the event.

It's never fun to be on the busy road during a sunny day. Amongst the buzzing traffic, dust and hot weather,  “The Green Path” organic restaurant creates a welcoming environment. As you enter the area, you feel the sudden change in atmosphere. A micro climate created by the greenery around, fresh air and beautiful ambience with an earthly interior. The events are run by volunteers. We checked at the reception and joined the community singing event. 

The founder of “The Green Path”, Sri. Jayaram H R, waved at us as soon as we entered the room and greeted us. We have known him for some time now. He is lively, enthusiastic, kind and cheerful like always. He invited us and welcomed us to introduce ourselves to the community gathered there. My son felt at home and went around the room to meet people and other children.

It was nostalgic to listen to some songs from old kannada movies, poems, hymns, folk songs, and many more melodies. We met people from varied interests. There were IT professionals, teachers, animal rescuers, singers, and others. We enjoyed listening to the songs, sang a few of them together. All in all it was a friendly gathering. 

Jayaram Sir invited all of us to have lunch that was organized for us. Organic millet khichdi, a drink prepared with lemon, mint and chia seeds, and lentil payasam were on the menu. They were delicious. We continued to have a full buffet lunch with our friends. There were a lot of traditional dishes, dishes prepared from millets, fresh fruits, salads and drinks. Food was delicious, healthy and very reasonably priced.

We paid a visit to their inhouse shop “Era Organic”, where they sell their farm produce and other organic products. You will find a wide variety of products like cold pressed coconut oil (you will get to see the cold pressing machine), groceries, products from coconut shells and much more. I once bought a handcrafted saree made of cotton at a very reasonable price. A visit to their “Sukrushi farm” in Nelamangala and Coorg is still on my to do list. 

On Sundays they arrange “Organic Santhe (market)” at the same venue. We were at one of the events. It’s a famous event that happens there every Sunday where you get to meet organic farmers, their produce, local artists, and some of the known personalities. Well known actors, singers and artists from various walks pay their visit to this organic restaurant and promote the noble cause. There are also eco parties hosted at The Green Path. 

It’s great to see the organic movement taking the ramp and reaching far and wide. Feel free to drop by and be part of this wonderful journey of The Green Path.
