Close to Tumkuru, among the dry and dull monoculture fields, there is a hidden gem. As the name says, it's set up finely as a model farm exhibiting the success of natural farming methods. The owner of the farm, Mr. Ravish, very humble and kind hearted, warmly welcomed us to his farm. He gave us a tour of the farm enthusiastically and shared the challenges they had along the way in bringing up the farm. He did not hesitate to share practical aspects and failures they faced around some of the so-called ideal farming practices. He shared the challenges they are facing regarding finding workers on the farm. He explained that on a daily basis there are a handful of 6-8 people taking care of the farm.

As we followed him, he also gave us some of the farm produce for relishing. They have a wide variety of plants and native species which they pledge to protect. The fruits taste heavenly as they had an opportunity to get complete nurturing from mother earth without any intervention. 

Nature has enormous potential in turning nothing to something amazing, given we let it be. Natural farming is a lot about unlearning farming methods that from ages farmers were made to believe are crucial for a good harvest. Greed and ignorance corrupts true farming and puts forth the commercial goals driving misguided actions. Consequences of this on humankind and nature are enormous which hits eventually.

Mr. Manjunath organizes lectures and discussions about natural farming methods from well known professors and experts on his farm. There is a dedicated seminar hall built in the middle of the farm for this. An earthly construction built from natural material. We just got a glimpse of it from outside as there wasnâ€™t any event planned that day. They offer a platform for farmers to discuss challenges with such farming and possible solutions. Also, they can connect you with a farmer nearby to work with you for any help with your farm. 

We wish the best to Mr. Ravish and the community who have set up and maintained the farm so well. Our heartfelt thanks to all the help and support they are offering to interested farmers and people alike.
