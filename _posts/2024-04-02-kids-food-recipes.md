Kids eat simple and colorful food. This isn’t a new thing you are hearing but I know it’s heck of a work to put together those colors that your kids would enjoy eating. I feel with you. Some of the fellow moms share that they are sad their children don’t eat well. 

I am repeating but please bear with me as it’s like a mantra you recite in your mind when you cook or serve food for your children. 

Children like “Simple, Colorful food”. Quantity? they decide. You got to trust them with that.

Not often children like what we like. So, we have to be patient and pay attention to their feedback. When they aren’t hungry but it’s time for your lunch or dinner, don’t force them. At the same time, don’t forget to include them during cooking and meal times. I think it is important to eat together. If not the same, a similar looking food that you are having, attracts them to try it. I usually keep a portion aside (when needed) before adding spices, more salt or sugar. Children are highly observant of what we are eating, how we are eating and how much we enjoy it. Having a routine is good but let’s admit it doesn’t work all the time. That’s okay. They know the best and are very much in tune with their body. All these points I am claiming here are things I have learnt over a period and continue to learn. When a child is running away from food, crying or resisting to eat, something isn’t right. Try to find out what’s going on. Take medical advice in dire situations.

Developing a good relationship with food is very crucial for the overall well being of a child. It’s never too late. Keep at it. Children are different. As parents, we need  to be patient and attentive. Always surround them with healthy food options and make it easy to access.

With regards to recipes I am talking about in this article, I am referring to kids older than a year or when they have grown teeth.

There are a few nature's own recipes children enjoy as they are without much manipulation. Not a vast list but let me note a few here.



* Cooked brown or black rice
* Roasted okra
* Sweet corn tossed in butter and a pinch of salt
* Plain cooked pasta or spaghetti (slightly softer than al-dente) etc
* Oven baked apple
* Oven baked pumpkin
* Oven baked sweet potato

and many more, keep discovering them. 

Here I share a few recipes that I have tried with my son. My son loves them and approves of sharing it with his friends out there. 

Below portions are roughly for 2-3 people(a small family). Tweak the quantity as needed. 

I majorly use organic quality products. Usually I prepare basmati or jasmine rice to go with some of the recipes noted here. If it's a different type of rice, I have called that out in the recipe. Attention though, see what kind of rice your child enjoys!


## Kokos lentil soup 

The spices are the secret ingredient here. It might seem a bit complicated. Feel free to try without it. Lentils taste good in any form.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>



* ½ cup Mung dal
* ½ cup Yellow/red lentils
* 2 ½ cups of water
* 100 ml coconut milk (you can add more if you wish)
* (Optional) Spice mix (Grind 20g fresh coriander, 2-5gm ginger, 1 clove garlic, ¼ inch cinnamon, 1-2 cardamom into a smooth paste or simply use 1  tbsp “[Zivina’s green thai curry](https://www.zivina.cz/thajske-zelene-kari-140g/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwYSwBhDcARIsAOyL0fhcUoltWc-yRlca-dFrJtTGmwJqS_uKkxqWQVcCvMbDtf2CH6waJK8aAoHjEALw_wcB)”)

* ¼ tsp of Turmeric
* Salt to taste

## Cute poke

A variation of the well known poke bowl for children. Except for the rice, all ingredients are measured for the child alone. Tweak it as you need and enjoy your poke with them with any additions you would like to make for your poke. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>



* 100g Black rice
* Handful of edamame
* Mango
* Avacado
* 2-3 Okra
* 1 tsp Vegetable oil
* Salt to taste
* Lemon juice to taste

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure</span>



* Cook black rice until soft (the grains are usually separate even if they are well done, that's a good one)
* Cut mango into medium sized cubes
* Cut avocado into medium sized cubes or vertically big enough for children to grab it in hand
* Prepare okra:
    * Take a pan, heat the oil on low medium heat. 
    * Add okra to the pan and roast them until slightly brown
    * Add some salt to taste and leave for a min more
* Arrange the poke bowl for your child. 

I would start with 1-2 tbsp rice, 5-6 cubes of mango, 2-3 pieces of avocado, a few edamame and keep okra on the top or stick it in a corner. Sprinkle a little salt and lemon juice. Ensure all the items are clearly visible for them and don’t clutter with more quantity. Feel free to tweak the ingredients with your child’s favorite fruits and veggies. 

**Note**: It’s not necessary you have all the ingredients. Starting with just rice is good. My son enjoys just eating black rice or brown rice. That’s how we started and added his favorite fruits and veggies together into a poke.


## Peas Pilao

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>



* 1 cup rice

* Salt to taste

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure</span>

* Add kasuri methi and give it a quick stir

## Viet Miso Soup

I learned it from a Vietnamese friend of mine. Thanks to her, my son loves it and enjoys saying the ingredients by name.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>



* ~750 ml water
* 2-3 medium sized mushrooms (shitake or regular white or brown ones)
* 100g (firm) tofu
* 1 tbsp miso (of your choice)
* A handful of dried seaweed (wakame)
* (optional) Salt to taste

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure</span>



* Add the water to a vessel and keep it a medium heat
* Slice mushroom (medium thickness) and add them to the water, give it a stir so that mushroom spread well and continue cooking
* Dice tofu into medium sized cubes and add them to the water, continue cooking
* Add seaweed when the water is hot
* _(You can add a little more water if you want to dilute it)_
* Continue cooking for few more mins until mushrooms are done well
* Turn the stove off and let the soup cool down a bit
* To the warm soup add miso (this is to retain the goodness of miso) and mix well

Ready to serve. If you have leftover soup, you can warm it up a bit before eating.
