Kids eat simple and colorful food. This isn’t a new thing you are hearing but I know it’s heck of a work to put together those colors that your kids would enjoy eating. I feel with you. Some of the fellow moms share that they are sad their children don’t eat well. 

I am repeating but please bear with me as it’s like a mantra you recite in your mind when you cook or serve food for your children. 

Children like “Simple, Colorful food”. Quantity? they decide. You got to trust them with that.

Not often children like what we like. So, we have to be patient and pay attention to their feedback. When they aren’t hungry but it’s time for your lunch or dinner, don’t force them. At the same time, don’t forget to include them during cooking and meal times. I think it is important to eat together. If not the same, a similar looking food that you are having, attracts them to try it. I usually keep a portion aside (when needed) before adding spices, more salt or sugar. Children are highly observant of what we are eating, how we are eating and how much we enjoy it. Having a routine is good but let’s admit it doesn’t work all the time. That’s okay. They know the best and are very much in tune with their body. All these points I am claiming here are things I have learnt over a period and continue to learn. When a child is running away from food, crying or resisting to eat, something isn’t right. Try to find out what’s going on. Take medical advice in dire situations.

Developing a good relationship with food is very crucial for the overall well being of a child. It’s never too late. Keep at it. Children are different. As parents, we need  to be patient and attentive. Always surround them with healthy food options and make it easy to access.

With regards to recipes I am talking about in this article, I am referring to kids older than a year or when they have grown teeth.

There are a few nature's own recipes children enjoy as they are without much manipulation. Not a vast list but let me note a few here.



* Cooked brown or black rice
* Roasted okra
* Sweet corn tossed in butter and a pinch of salt
* Plain cooked pasta or spaghetti (slightly softer than al-dente) etc
* Oven baked apple
* Oven baked pumpkin
* Oven baked sweet potato

and many more, keep discovering them. 

Here I share a few recipes that I have tried with my son. My son loves them and approves of sharing it with his friends out there. 

Below portions are roughly for 2-3 people(a small family). Tweak the quantity as needed. 

I majorly use organic quality products. Usually I prepare basmati or jasmine rice to go with some of the recipes noted here. If it's a different type of rice, I have called that out in the recipe. Attention though, see what kind of rice your child enjoys!



## Kokos lentil soup 

The spices are the secret ingredient here. It might seem a bit complicated. Feel free to try without it. Lentils taste good in any form.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>



* ½ cup Mung dal
* ½ cup Yellow/red lentils
* 2 ½ cups of water
* 100 ml coconut milk (you can add more if you wish)

## Cute poke

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/kid-food.jpg)

A variation of the well known poke bowl for children. Except for the rice, all ingredients are measured for the child alone. Tweak it as you need and enjoy your poke with them with any additions you would like to make for your poke. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>



* 100g Black rice
* Handful of edamame
* Mango
* Avacado
* 2-3 Okra
* 1 tsp Vegetable oil
* Salt to taste
* Lemon juice to taste

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure</span>



* Cook black rice until soft (the grains are usually separate even if they are well done, that's a good one)
* Cut mango into medium sized cubes
* Cut avocado into medium sized cubes or vertically big enough for children to grab it in hand
* Prepare okra:
    * Take a pan, heat the oil on low medium heat. 
    * Add okra to the pan and roast them until slightly brown
    * Add some salt to taste and leave for a min more
* Arrange the poke bowl for your child. 

I would start with 1-2 tbsp rice, 5-6 cubes of mango, 2-3 pieces of avocado, a few edamame and keep okra on the top or stick it in a corner. Sprinkle a little salt and lemon juice. Ensure all the items are clearly visible for them and don’t clutter with more quantity. Feel free to tweak the ingredients with your child’s favorite fruits and veggies. 

**Note**: It’s not necessary you have all the ingredients. Starting with just rice is good. My son enjoys just eating black rice or brown rice. That’s how we started and added his favorite fruits and veggies together into a poke.

## Gobi Methi Malai

A recent hit from my kitchen. My family and friends gave a big thumbs up. I tried it at a community event for a gathering of 15+ people. It turned out to be a favorite among all.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients</span>

* 10-12 medium sized florets of cauli flower
* 50g tofu (or paneer) medium sized dices
* 20g of frozen peas
* 100ml Sour cream (12-15% fat)
* Spice mix - ½ tsp cumin powder, 1 tsp coriander powder, (optional) ½ tsp sweet chilly powder
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil (olive oil)
* ½ tsp cumin
* ½ tbsp Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
* Salt to taste
* _Optionally other vegetables like potato, tomato, mushrooms, onions can be added (chopped into slightly big pieces)_

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure</span>

* Prepare cauli flower: *_Wash the cauliflower well and cook them in a steamer for 3-5 mins. **You can prepare and add other vegetables._
* Take a deep bottom pan (or iron pot)
* Add oil on medium heat and wait until its warm
* Add cumin seeds and wait for them to splutter
* Add spice mix and give a quick stir
* Add peas and pinch of salt. Mix well and cook for a minute or two
* Add cauli flower, tofu and salt as you need
* Mix well and cook for 2 minutes
* Crush the methi on your palm and spread it evenly on the dish
* Add the sour cream and give it a gentle but good mix.
* Turn the stove off and cover with a lid

Ready to serve in a minute or two. You can enjoy it with rice, tortilla, chapathi or bread. Especially for adults, you may want to try an idea that came up during the community event that I mentioned earlier. You can prepare a burrito with some rice, gobi methi malai and/or any sauces or herbs of your choice, all wrapped in a tortilla. Thanks to the lovely community of people who were happy to try my dish and their creativity.

*_Depending on the size of the cauli flower florets the time it takes for cooking might vary. Check regularly to make sure they are crunchy. Cooking slightly over or under, both aren’t good. It might take some trials._

_**Optional items can be added in the mentioned order_

* _You might want to double the spice mix, add more tofu (or paneer), peas and sour cream if you are adding more veggies and according to your taste_
* _Onions go right after the cumin seeds and are roasted until they turn slightly golden. A pinch of salt at this time will help the onion cook well._
* _Tomatoes will go right after the spices are added and cook for 2 mins. _
* _Potatoes can be precooked separated in water to well done crunchy bites and added along with cauli flower_
* _Capsicum and/or mushrooms can go with peas. _
