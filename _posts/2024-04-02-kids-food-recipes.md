Kids eat simple and colorful food. This isn’t a new thing you are hearing but I know it’s heck of a work to put together those colors that your kids would enjoy eating. I feel with you. Some of the fellow moms share that they are sad their children don’t eat well. 

I am repeating but please bear with me as it’s like a mantra you recite in your mind when you cook or serve food for your children. 

Children like “Simple, Colorful food”. Quantity? they decide. You got to trust them with that.

Not often children like what we like. So, we have to be patient and pay attention to their feedback. When they aren’t hungry but it’s time for your lunch or dinner, don’t force them. At the same time, don’t forget to include them during cooking and meal times. I think it is important to eat together. If not the same, a similar looking food that you are having, attracts them to try it. I usually keep a portion aside (when needed) before adding spices, more salt or sugar. Children are highly observant of what we are eating, how we are eating and how much we enjoy it. Having a routine is good but let’s admit it doesn’t work all the time. That’s okay. They know the best and are very much in tune with their body. All these points I am claiming here are things I have learnt over a period and continue to learn. When a child is running away from food, crying or resisting to eat, something isn’t right. Try to find out what’s going on. Take medical advice in dire situations.

Developing a good relationship with food is very crucial for the overall well being of a child. It’s never too late. Keep at it. Children are different. As parents, we need  to be patient and attentive. Always surround them with healthy food options and make it easy to access.

With regards to recipes I am talking about in this article, I am referring to kids older than a year or when they have grown teeth.

There are a few nature's own recipes children enjoy as they are without much manipulation. Not a vast list but let me note a few here.



* Cooked brown or black rice
* Roasted okra
* Sweet corn tossed in butter and a pinch of salt
* Plain cooked pasta or spaghetti (slightly softer than al-dente) etc
* Oven baked apple
* Oven baked pumpkin
* Oven baked sweet potato

and many more, keep discovering them. 

Here I share a few recipes that I have tried with my son. My son loves them and approves of sharing it with his friends out there. 

Below portions are roughly for 2-3 people(a small family). Tweak the quantity as needed. 

I majorly use organic quality products. Usually I prepare basmati or jasmine rice to go with some of the recipes noted here. If it's a different type of rice, I have called that out in the recipe. Attention though, see what kind of rice your child enjoys!


## Kokos lentil soup 

The spices are the secret ingredient here. It might seem a bit complicated. Feel free to try without it. Lentils taste good in any form.
