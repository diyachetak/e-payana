If you are visiting Mumbai, pay a visit to the [Mohraan farms](https://www.mohraan.com/index.html) in the nearby town, Shahapur. The name of the farm comes from the Mahua ([Madhuca longifolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhuca_longifolia)) trees that grow in that area. The story of Mohraan began when a teacher bought a piece of land and tended it to grow a food forest. Today it’s a home for a variety of trees, birds, animals and other creatures living in harmony. It’s worth a visit!

We started early in the morning and arrived there around 9 am. Cool breeze and greenery of the farm eased us after the long drive. We settled down at the entrance hall of an earthly construction which melts into the surrounding nature, helping ourselves to water. After a short while we were invited to a healthy sumptuous breakfast by the friendly Staff. They took personal care in arranging food for my little son, who was 14 months when we visited them. I fondly recall how much he enjoyed everything there. I still carry the taste of the Jungle tea that was served which was made of wild herbs and flowers collected from the farm. 

The tour started under a Mahua tree which stands there extending welcome to the nature lovers. We had a walking tour of the farm. The guide, son of the founder, one of the twin brothers who is an IT professional, delved into the details of founding of the farm, its history, the biodiversity they home and natural methods of farming that they practice and the benefits. 

After the tour, we enjoyed water sports in a stream that passes through the farm. You will enjoy a walk through the beauty of the farm unraveling a wonderful view of the waterfront. We tried kayaking and canoeing. I was lost in the rhythm of the water, cool breeze and surrounding nature. It was so peaceful and rejuvenating. It’s about 2km from the farm to the swimming spot. We deferred the swim for another visit as my son was too small to enjoy that. 

We were informed that the lunch was ready. We were delighted by the variety of food served. Aam ras (mango pulp) prepared from the farm produce was the highlight. It tasted heavenly. On request they prepared vegetarian meals for us. A mix of cuisines from north and south of India. 

We relaxed for a while after lunch. Enjoyed playing some fun games, going around the farm and taking a nap in the hammock. There is nothing like taking a nap in the open under a tree. In the evening, we sat around the table for an evening tea/coffee with snacks. We exchanged thoughts with the founder, a elderly man who is very humble. We did not miss taking a snap with him as a memory of our visit.  

We heard about unschooling for the first time there. The granddaughter of the founder has been unschooled since she was 6 years old. She and her father were happy to join us to share their thoughts and experience with unschooling. She was shining with confidence and expertise. She was beyond her age. We learnt that she spends a lot of time reading books and she was learning Latin when we met her. Her idea was to read the legendary Hamlet and other books in the original language they were written in. Unschooling seemed a wonderful alternative to today’s schooling or even to homeschooling. The child is let free to explore and learn, find their passion. 

 We ended the trip by paying our adios to the family and staff. We hope to connect back to them in the future and learn more about farming and unschooling.
